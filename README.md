# RasterFairy
The purpose of Raster Fairy is to transform any kind of 2D point cloud into a regular raster whilst trying to preserve the neighborhood relations that were present in the original cloud. A typical use case is if you have a similarity clustering of images and want to show the images in a regular table structure.
